# LAB_FUNCTIONS_101

## Create a function that takes 1 parameter of type int , then it prints out the result formatted like the following patter (if we give it 5 for example):

**Example Output for `5`**
```
5 4 3 2 1   
4 3 2 1   
3 2 1   
2 1   
1   
```

#### Document the newly created function. describe what it does, then print the documentation. 


# Bonus
Rewrite the previous function so that it returns the pattern as a string, then assign the result to a variables and print it.
